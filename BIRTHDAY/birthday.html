    <h2>How it all started.....</h2>

    <div class="memory">
      <img src="swimming.jpg" alt="Our first time to go swimming">
      <p>Remember the day we went swimming? We laughed endlessly, splashed like kids, 
      and for those hours, the world felt like nothing but joy. I still have the recollection of memories like it was yesterday. It’s one of those moments 
      that still makes me smile whenever I think of it. At that point, we were still aquaintances, just knowing each other by name, greet casually and met only in social occasions. We had limited personal connection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="memory">
        <video controls>
        <source src="swimming2.jpg" type="video/mp4">
      </video> 
      <p>Remember this video? That day at the pool still cracks me up — we weren’t even doing anything crazy, just swimming around and talking, when this video came up. 
        It was such a small moment, but it turned into one of those memories I’ll never forget — 
        proof that with you, even the simplest things become unforgettable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory">
      <video controls>
        <source src="groupwork.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <p>Working with you during group work was always special. While others sometimes saw it as just another task,
        for me it was another chance to laugh over little mistakes, to brainstorm wild ideas, and to encourage each 
        other when things got tough.
        Looking back, it wasn’t just about finishing — it was about the way you made every moment worthwhile simply by being there.
    
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory">
      <img src="classvibe.jpg" alt="Studying together">
      <p>You were my anchor in the endless sea of books 📚 — the steady flame that kept the midnight oil from burning out. 
        In the quiet battles against fatigue and doubt, you stood as both compass and companion, reminding me that even the heaviest pages grew lighter when shared.  
        Every challenge, you were the spark that turned weariness into resilience, and together, 
        we carved pathways through the wilderness of learning as though our minds were two lanterns illuminating the same road.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory">
      <img src="hiking.jpg" alt="Some moments from our nature walks">
      <p>And then there were the hikes ⛰️ — Those walks through nature were never just steps on a trail 
        they were journeys through the quiet poetry of the earth. You were the rhythm to my stride,
        the laughter that echoed through the trees, I remember the audacity of Fari trying to give us direction knowing it never existed in her vocabularies. 
        Every hill we climbed felt less like a struggle and more like a shared triumph, as though the mountains themselves bent down to witness our bond. 
        The wind, the leaves, the horizon — they all seemed to conspire with us, reminding me that with you, even the path less travelled feels like home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory">
      <video controls>
        <source src= "friendship.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video> 
      <p>Our friendship has always been more than shared time — it is a tapestry woven from threads of laughter, trials, and forgiveness. 
        Every smile became a brushstroke, every tear a note in the song we’ve written together. Even in moments of disagreement, 
        we were like rivers meeting rocks — not broken, only reshaped, flowing stronger as we moved forward. 
        What we share feels timeless, a bond that has quietly blossomed into something deeper, 
        something that carries the weight of love wrapped in the gentleness of trust. 💖</p>
    </div>
    <div class="memory">
      <video controls>
        <source src="afterexams.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <p>If I had to define our friendship, I’d say it is a rare kind of magic — 
        the kind that turns ordinary days into stories worth remembering, and silence into comfort instead of distance. 
        You’ve been the constant light when things grew dim, the laughter that stitched together the broken days, 
        and the reminder that true connection doesn’t need perfection, only presence. 
        With you, I’ve learned that friendship isn’t measured by how easy the road is, but by who walks beside you even when the road is rough. 
        And for me, that will always be you. 💕
      </p>
